# RetrieveSMSMessages

Android app written in Kotlin that will retrieve data from the SMS Inbox and Outbox. 
Uses an Intent to share the resultant JSON file, so the user can pick where to send the file easily.

I have a further writeup of this app on my blog: link [here](https://omgardner.github.io/kotlin-sms-extractor-app/).
